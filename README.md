# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Steps to get Final Code
### streamline the process of identifying and restructuring the React project, follow these steps:
1. Begin with the index.js file, as it serves as the entry point for the React project.
2. Navigate to the page or component linked in the browser tab, such as ....../yum-r/admin/orders/9F36CA.
3. Identify the corresponding page or component within the project's structure, residing in the folder path admin > orders > [orderId].
4. Extract this folder from the project code.
5. Proceed with updating import statements and folder structure based on the project's layout.
6. Remove any redundant or unused code and files to declutter the project.

## Reasoning for inability to strictly stick to the provided folder structure
1. Organizing files from the same folder can become cumbersome when importing them into a project. To mitigate potential errors, I've opted for a nested loop approach within the folder. This not only streamlines the process but also helps in maintaining clarity and organization.
2. My plan is to arrange the files into a "components" subfolder within the "layout" folder. This decision stems from the necessity to avoid errors and simplify the management of numerous files. By grouping them logically, it ensures a smoother workflow and reduces the likelihood of confusion or oversight.
   
## Reasoning for inability to get rid of all the redundant code in the given timeframe
To effectively manage the import statements and streamline code extraction from a given project, I employ a strategy that involves preserving redundant data, files, and code temporarily. This ensures clarity in the output and facilitates the identification of essential components for further action.

### For better version:

"In order to manage import statements effectively and streamline the extraction of code from a given project, I adopt a method that involves temporarily retaining redundant data, files, and code. This approach ensures clarity in the output and facilitates the identification of essential components for subsequent actions. By maintaining this redundancy, I can confidently assess which code and files need to be removed to achieve the desired outcome within the given timeframe."
